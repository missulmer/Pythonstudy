# learning about inputs

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

# the commas , at the end of the line cause the line to end so that the questions don't run into each other.

print "So you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (
	age, height, weight)

# perfect run. Good job.
