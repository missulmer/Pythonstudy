There once was a Rabbit and a Tiger.
They lived in the very same wood.
Tiger was very big and strong, he did whatever he would.

Rabbit had seen him, stalking through her stomping ground.
She had been smart to stay away, but one day she decided to march up and say,
"Who the fuck are you, and what is it that you do?"

It was from that day, which began the Tiger and Rabbit play.
